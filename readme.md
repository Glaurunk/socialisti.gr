This is my first on demand project, a simple blog made with Laravel after been recommended to me as a great tool - and it really is! I am really happy I followed this advice and moved from Wordpress to Laravel. Never going to look back again!
The client is a lawyer and I chose for him a simple and readable layout because the posts of the blog are lengthy political articles, so readability is a must in this case. 
Because of my lack of knowledge at the time and of the low demands of the project the back end has been integrated with the front end; the back end consisting of some utility buttons appearing when the owner of the blog logs in - no registration allowed.
Besides the programming, I also designed a logo for him and all the necessaru graphics.
Moving on to bigger things, check my other works as well and feel free if you ever bother to point out my mistakes or bad practices; I'd be happy to learn something new :)

Best regards to all.
